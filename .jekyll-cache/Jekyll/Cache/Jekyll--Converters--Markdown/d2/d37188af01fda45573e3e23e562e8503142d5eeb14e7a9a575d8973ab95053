I"”<p>One of the very first things I did when I started learning how to build applications with React was run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code>. Then I sat back and watched as my terminal worked some magic and then voila!, out came a fresh React app, ready to be molded into my new idea. At that point, I was a bit too excited about getting in there and building something to really spend time figuring out what exactly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> did for me, but when it came time to build more applications, I began to wonder, what exactly was going on under the hood?</p>
