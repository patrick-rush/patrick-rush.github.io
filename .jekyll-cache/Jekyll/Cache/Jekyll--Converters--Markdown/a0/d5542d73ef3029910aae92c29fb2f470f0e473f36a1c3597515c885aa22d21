I"Ì<p>Some people grow up knowing exactly what they want to do. I knew that I didnâ€™t want to choose. I had so many interests, so many things that fascinated me about the world. How could I favor just one? Now, over the years, Iâ€™ve come to understand the beauty of specialization. The profound advantage of deep and nuanced understanding of a particular subject cannot be overstated. But what Iâ€™ve also (thankfully) come to understand is that specialization, or deep entrenchment in one peculiar subject, can blind you in a way. Iâ€™ve had a lot of incredible opportunities to broaden my experience in life (flying planes, teaching English as a second language, working as a professional cellist on a cruise ship, managing a restaurant, etc.), and each thing I have dived into has taught me something about the previous thing and prepared me in some way for the next. The in-between, the space that exists in the distance from one subject to another, holds so much.</p>
