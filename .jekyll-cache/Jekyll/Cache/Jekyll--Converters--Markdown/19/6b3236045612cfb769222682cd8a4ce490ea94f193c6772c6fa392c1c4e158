I"¦<p>Iâ€™ve just finished building my first Rails web application, a simple to-do app built for collaboration among friends. I faced a few interesting challenges along the way, but perhaps my favorite was when I decided to introduce a nested form. See, for the purposes of streamlining the relationships in this app, I wanted Projects and Users to only be related through Tasks. If a User has created a Task associated with a Project, that Project should then show up on their homepage. The problem arises, though, when a User creates a new Project that has no Tasks. So, to fix this, I made sure that new Projects were created with a new Task with the help of a nested form.</p>
