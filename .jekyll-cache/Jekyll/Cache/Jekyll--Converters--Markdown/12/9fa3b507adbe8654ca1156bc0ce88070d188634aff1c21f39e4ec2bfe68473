I"þ<p>Six weeks have gone by fast. Iâ€™m at the end of the first part of my Flatiron journey, and I feel great so far! The final requirement for the first unit is to create a CLI program that draws data from an external source, namely via an API or scraping. I found an API for breweries in the United States, and since I enjoy a good craft beer from time to time and I live in one of the top cities for craft beer in the world, I thought Iâ€™d build a program that helps users locate breweries to check out.</p>
