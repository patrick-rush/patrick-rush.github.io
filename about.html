<!-- <p>The first decade of my adult life has been spent working in the coffee industry and as a professional musician. The time has come to transition to something new. Follow along with my journey through Flatiron School's online software engineering program. Hopefully we'll both learn a thing or two along the way!</p> -->
<p>Whether it be through writing code, making music, leading a team, or creating something with my hands, my goal has always been to leave things a little more beautiful than I found them. Since beginning my transition to tech, I've loved seeing all the ways my history has prepared me for life in this industry. Collaboration, dedication, attention to detail, independenceâ€”all things I bring with me. I'm looking forward to carrying each of them and a little bit of beauty into my work as a software engineer. </p>
